# Fixed Middle Right Navigation

This way of navigation is to fixed the nav to the right of the body, then vertically middle each item of the nav item. It fits for the icon-based or aligned item list for user to navigate.

## User experience

The fixed right position is easily clickable and touchable, especially on mobile device.

## Good looking

The vertical aligned position break the traditional layout, but is more interesting and enjoyable.

## Less

Not very flexible for irregular nav list.

The mobile device looking is not very good, in personal perspective
